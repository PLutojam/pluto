    <p><em>This article is about the <strong>dwarf planet</strong>.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Pluto</strong> is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt,
        a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.
        It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive
        known object to directly orbit the Sun.It is the
        largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume,
        by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris.
        Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of
        ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets.
        Compared to Earth's moon, Pluto has only one sixth its mass
        and one third its volume.</p>

    <p>Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit,
        ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units
        from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach
        Pluto at its average distance.
        Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer
        to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance
        prevents them from colliding.</p>

    <p>Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest,
        whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto;
        Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon
        are sometimes considered a binary system because
        the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within
        either body, and they are tidally locked.
        The New Horizons mission was the first spacecraft
        to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14,
        2015 and taking detailed measurements and observations.
