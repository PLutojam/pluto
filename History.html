    <p>The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the
        orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell
        calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without
        success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto
        was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant
        planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding
        was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of
        William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.</p>

    <p>Pluto was appropriately given the Roman name for the god of the underworld in Greek mythology.
        The symbol for dwarf planet Pluto is a monogram made up of P and L in Pluto (and also the initials of Percival
        Lowell, who predicted its discovery).
